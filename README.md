# Blender Skeletal Character Animation Project

Welcome to the Blender Skeletal Character Animation Project! This project aims to provide a comprehensive demonstration of character animation in Blender, encompassing both healthy and movement disorder conditions.

## Project Overview

The steps I took to complete this project are as follows:

1. **Creating and Animate a Skeletal Character:**
   - I actually  used an existing character mesh.

   - I rigged the model using the Rigify Add-on in blender.

   - Sculpting face  details, adding hair, and clothing were added manually.

2. **Add Textures and Clothing:**
   - Enhance the visual appeal by incorporating suitable textures and clothing onto the animated character.

3. **Animate Healthy Conditions:**
   - Demonstrated four common human motion patterns (e.g., walking, running, jumping, sitting) under healthy conditions.

4. **Animate Movement Disorder Conditions:**
   - Mimicked clinically known movement disorders as closely as possible (Hemiplegic Gait, Myopathic Gait).
